                                1) CONSIDER YOUR STUDY ENVIRONMENT
                            </h4>
                            <p class="blog-card-description">
                                Finding a suitable place to study can be a challenge for some students. Library is one of such silent place where you find a 
                                lot of relatable books that help you to focus more on the topic. You may be lucky enough to have easy access to a library facility 
                                at school. However, many students study at home. But, often home is not helpful to effective study. Take some time to understand your 
                                personal requirements in terms of location and conditions that enable you to study effectively. Try to maintain a flexible and adaptable 
                                approach as your situation may change during the course of your study. When starting of study, or when reviewing your current circumstances,
                                it may be useful to ask yourself the following questions. Will you be studying mainly from home or at your school or library or somewhere else?
                                Do you study better in a peaceful setting, one which is free from interruptions, or do you prefer to have others around you, perhaps being able to 
                                interact with family, friends? Around the same time each day will work wonders for both your digestive system and productivity levels. Stick to eating 
                                brain fuel foods. These won't make you crash and feel rubbish an hour later. And, if possible, factor in 15–30 minutes of exercise each day. Even a brisk 
                                walk around the block before starting work can help. You could also ditch the bus and walk to the library instead.

                               2) TEACH CONTENT TO ANOTHER PERSON

                                A very effective way to check whether you have learned course content is to try to teach that information to another person (e.g., to a study mate). 
                                The challenge of explaining key concepts in your own words and make them understandable to others will quickly reveal whether you have truly mastered 
                                that information. These are the different study habits to be cultivated by the students in order to gain good knowledge on their subject. Besides 
                                following the tips for improving study habits, the study skills such as improving attention and concentration in studies and improving the memory of
                                the students, having great reading skills and writing skills also helps students to achieve more.

                        </h4>
                        <p class="blog-card-description">
                            While thinking about your place of study, some thought should also be given to organizing. You may have large amounts of material such as notes, 
                            textbooks and workbooks. Try to keep your materials organized in suitably indexed files, making use of a system of labeling that is clear, bold and 
                            easy to read at a glance. Be organized and file your materials instead of examining through piles of papers over and over looking for that one sheet 
                            which can help you to save a lot of time. Rearrange/organize your bookshelf/almarah every week to save your time avoid confusion. You should always 
                            make sure that you carry all the materials and tools you need, in case you plan to study in different locations at different times. These are the 
                            different study habits to be cultivated by the students in order to gain good knowledge on their subject. Besides following the tips for improving 
                            study habits, the study skills such as improving attention and concentration in studies and improving the memory of the students, having great 
                            reading skills and writing skills also helps students to achieve more.
