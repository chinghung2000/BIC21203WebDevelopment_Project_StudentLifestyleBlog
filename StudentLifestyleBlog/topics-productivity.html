                                1) CREATE A WORK ROUTINE
                            </h4>
                            <p class="blog-card-description">
                                One of the most significant ways to work more productively is to create a morning routine. It's important to start waking up, working and taking breaks at around the same time each day. The student lifestyle of deadlines, nights out, and streaming marathons can mean it's tricky to get to sleep at a decent hour. But, it's always important to wake up at the same time each morning if you can. This helps you start your day on the right foot. Getting up early might leave you feeling a bit groggy at first. But once your body clock has had time to adjust, 
                                you should find that it gets easier to fall asleep at night. And if you're struggling, try Sleep Cycle, one of our essential apps for students. This features a smart alarm, which should wake you up when you're in a lighter sleep. Also make sure you put away all gadgets with a screen at least 30 minutes before you go to bed. The blue light from these devices tricks your brain into thinking it's still daytime, making it harder to fall asleep if you use them at night. As well as regulating your sleep pattern, eating your meals and snacks
                                 around the same time each day will work wonders for both your digestive system and productivity levels. Stick to eating brain fuel foods. These won't make you crash and feel rubbish an hour later. And, if possible, factor in 15–30 minutes of exercise each day. Even a brisk walk around the block before starting work can help. You could also ditch the bus and walk to the library instead.

                               2) SET ACHIEVABLE WORK GOALS
                            </h4>
                            <p class="blog-card-description">
                                Setting yourself a range of goals is the perfect way to motivate yourself. This works whether you're aiming for some first class grades, working within a monthly spending budget or even just trying to make it to every class that week. 
                                The key is to set realistic and achievable goals. If you set too many targets that are overly ambitious, you'll get used to the idea that you won't reach them. Then, gradually, you'll stop trying to, which is totally unproductive. Instead, 
                                focus on SMART goals. These are: Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant and Time-bound. Begin with an easily attainable 'trigger goal' (e.g. dragging yourself out of bed to go to the gym before your morning lecture). Trigger goals are the 
                                perfect push you need to feel more motivated. The rest of your goals will feel more achievable when you've hit the ground running. But what if you tend to set goals but struggle to stick to them? Try setting some small 'punishments' for not meeting goals. 
                                Although it doesn't work for everyone, it can be a great source of motivation. For example, imagine you've planned to finish the first draft of an essay before Friday. If you don't manage it, the consequence could be that you're not allowed a night out on Friday.

                            3) TAKE SCREEN BREAKS
                        </h4>
                        <p class="blog-card-description">
                            Taking breaks doesn't mean switching from writing an essay to checking TikTok 20 times a day. By 'break', we really mean break. Pull yourself away from your computer and do something totally unrelated for a few minutes. Go for a walk.
                             Do some exercise. Have a cup of tea and a chat with your flatmate. Do whatever it takes to help you switch off. You might think that working solidly for five hours is a great achievement – and it kind of is. But remember that it's almost 
                             impossible to work to the best of your ability for that long, particularly if you make it a daily habit. When you're knee-deep in uni work, it can be easy to forget that have limits (you're only human). But you need to give yourself time 
                             to relax throughout the day. Taking breaks will help you stay happy, healthy and avoid burning out. It's not about how much time you spend studying, but how effectively you use that time. Quality over quantity.
